# Red Flag Detection using YOLOv8

This project aims to detect red flags in images using YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm. The detection of red flags can have various applications such as safety monitoring, hazard detection, or even in the context of flag recognition.

## Introduction

This project utilizes YOLOv8, an advanced object detection algorithm, to detect red flags in images. The model is trained on a dataset containing images with red flags and utilizes transfer learning to fine-tune the pre-trained YOLOv8 model specifically for this task.

## Installation

To run the code and perform red flag detection, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python (>=3.6)
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- YOLOv8 weights (pre-trained or fine-tuned for red flag detection)

You can install the required Python packages using pip:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

To perform red flag detection on an image, you can use the provided `detect_red_flag.py` script. Simply provide the path to the image as an argument, and the script will output the detected red flags along with their bounding boxes.

Example usage:

bash
python detect_red_flag.py --image_path /path/to/image.jpg


## Training

If you wish to train the YOLOv8 model on your own dataset for red flag detection, you can follow these steps:

1. **Dataset Preparation**: Gather a dataset containing images with red flags along with corresponding annotations (bounding boxes).
2. **Configuration**: Modify the YOLOv8 configuration file (`yolov8.cfg`) to suit your dataset and training preferences.
3. **Training**: Train the model using the provided `train.py` script. You may need to fine-tune the pre-trained weights on your dataset.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model on a validation set to assess its performance.
5. **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model for red flag detection in your application or environment.
